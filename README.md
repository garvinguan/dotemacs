# dotemacs
The Basic configuration for my emacs. 

# Where to put
Please the .emacs file and .emacs.d directory in your home or ~/ 

# How to use
I keep personal info in the private.el file so before this configuration can be used, simply remove line 2
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/private.el")
then start up emacs and all the packages I use should be downloaded and autoloaded when first used.
